# observation_visualizer

This short Jupyter notebook was produced with the help of Chat-GPT.
1. Hand-labeled all dead brown pelican observations on iNaturalist for 2024 on the West Coast of North America that I could find.
2. Created the [2024 Brown Pelican Mortality Event project](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/2024-brown-pelican-mortality-event).
3. Exported data to csv.
4. Loaded csv to notebook to produce visualization of observations over time.

This project should be extensible to other types of observations, and only requires a csv with `time_observed_at, latitude, longitude`.
